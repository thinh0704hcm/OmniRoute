/**

 * computed, surfaced so a route can name it in an audit line WITHOUT re-running
 * the gate (omni-code-review LEDGER-3/9):
 *
 *   - `none`       — no key presented (anonymous or session-only caller);
 *   - `unresolved` — a key was presented but no row matches (deleted, rotated, mistyped);
 *   - `invalid`    — the row exists but failed `validateApiKey`
 *                    (is_active / revoked_at / is_banned / expires_at);
 *   - `valid`      — passed the gate; `apiKeyId` and `apiKeyMetadata` are set.
 *
 * `apiKeyId !== null` ⟺ `keyState === "valid"`. Additive field: every consumer
 * that only reads `apiKeyId` keeps working unchanged.

/**
 * Canonical per-record ownership check for API-key-scoped resources (files,
 * batches, …). Three callers, three answers — the same model as the sweep
 * scoping in `deleteCompletedBatches()` (GHSA-wvxc-jp3v-5mg5):
 *
 *   - the operator's own dashboard (session auth) may act on ANY record;
 *   - an API key may act on its OWN records only;
 *   - a record with no owner (null/undefined `api_key_id`) is unattributable
 *     and is denied to every non-session caller — an anonymous request and a
 *     foreign key alike. "No owner" is NOT "no restriction": every file/batch
 *     row has carried `api_key_id` since the table was created, so a null
 *     owner is an anonymous or dashboard-session write (or a batch artifact
 *     inheriting one), and letting any principal read, download or delete it
 *     was GHSA-2jm2-mpx8-6523.
 *
 * `getApiKeyRequestScope` never sets `rejection` — with `REQUIRE_API_KEY=false`
 * the central policy admits both a missing and an invalid bearer as anonymous —
 * so `{ apiKeyId: null, isSessionAuth: false }` is exactly the anonymous shape
 * and must never match a record. A revoked, expired or banned key (fails
 * `validateApiKey`) is folded into that same shape by `getApiKeyRequestScope`
 * itself (#13881) — do not reintroduce a path that trusts `apiKeyId` without
 * that lifecycle gate.
